\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The Smiley Sisters Carnival traveled throughout the eastern
United States during the 1950s. Beginning in 1956, young men in
the towns visited by the carnival became plagued by a strange
form of leprosy originating in the hands and swiftly moving up the
arms. As the death toll climbed, newspapers named the disease
"Farmer's Rot".
\par Rumors began circulating that the carnival itself was to blame. In
November of 1959, the townspeople of \censor{longet text},
Georgia took it upon themselves to raze the carnival to the ground,
believing the entertainers to be servants of the devil.
\par Bureau agents had been monitoring the carnival while
investigating the odd disease. Posing as \censor{super mega longest text yes no}
, agents confiscated all carnival
property that survived the flames. At a field office, stray \censor{super longest ye}
were placed in rooms with individual pieces of the
carnival equipment. The game hammer was identified as the
cause of the disease. The remaining property was incinerated,
along with the infected \censor{longest text}.
The carnival owners were told they had been carrying a dangerous pathogen in their
equipment.
