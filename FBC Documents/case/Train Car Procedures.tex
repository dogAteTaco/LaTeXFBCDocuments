by simply not entering it. Proper signage
and barriers should provide sufficient
containment.

Investigations Sector's AWE West
hangar for ongoing investigations.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:}

to a \censor{longer text} and not the physical item's own history.
\par Causation for this link is still to be determined, but possibilities
include the outside interference possibly responsible for the
item's altered state or trauma imprinting via shared memory
states.

\par The item was discovered when the Bureau responded to a
suspected crime scene in Bloomington, Illinois. The item was
identified as an Altered Item and transported to the Bureau for
examination and testing. See AWE-44 for further details.
