\subsection*{ActionMaxx Camera (AI80-UE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The item first came to the Bureau's attention after a hospitalized
mailman from \censor{text longer}, Arkansas claimed his injuries had
been caused by a movie camera. Further investigation connected
the incident to AIBO, which was being shipped in the mail truck at
the time. The packaged camera was later found in an empty
warehouse. The return address led agents to a PO Box located in
the San Fernando Valley belonging to a company called Blessed
Pictures. Whether Blessed Pictures is involved in the creation
and dissemination of the item's VHS films is unknown (see
investigation 13-HQ-612).
\par The following is a list of all known films believed to have been shot
by A180-UE.

\par *Item was used in the filming of an unreleased western in 1968
on the Italian island of Sardinia. A cast member was killed during
an on-set accident, stopping production. It is believed that
Blessed Pictures bought the camera when equipment from the
shoot was sold at auction.
