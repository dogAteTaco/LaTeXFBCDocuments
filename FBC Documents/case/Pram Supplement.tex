\subsection*{Smoking Pram (AI13-KE)}
\subsubsection*{SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:}
\par (interview with \censor{longer text}, conducted with the aid of a French
translator on Nov. 1 7, 2009 in a retirement home in \censor{longer text},
France)
\par A: Where were you on August 2, 1979, Mr. Beaulieu?
\par RB (translated from French): So specific a date! (laughter) As if I
could ever forget. I was called to a fire at the Rue \censor{longest texts}.
\par A: What did you see?
\par RB: Smoke, white like a new Pope, rising up from the windows of
a small shop. I sent my men in. I was fire chief back then.
\par A: What happened next?
\par RB: We pulled the shop owner out. He was already dead. Smoke
in his lungs. We found the source afterwards. A baby's walker.
Poured water onto it, but that only encouraged the smoke. We
pulled the carriage outside. Smoke kept shooting out! A crowd
gathered. People said it was a miracle. But I disagreed. It seemed
to me like more of an omen. We brought the strange thing back to
the fire hall. Some Americans, like yourself, came later and took it
away.
