\par (Text transcribed from the item)
\par "For ten years I've tried to write my escape, only sinking deeper. I
used to know where fiction ends and reality begins. Here, they
are all the same. It's a hideous trap, my every thought made real.
Fear. Desire. HOW can I ever know for sure I've escaped and not
just lost in my own fantasy of it? That thought alone can drive you
mad."
\par The identifiable words in the scratched-out portion:
"Falls" (Bright Falls?), "haunting", "Wake" (Alan Wake?), "light
switch", "ocean", "too late", and the final sentence "You've been
warned".
