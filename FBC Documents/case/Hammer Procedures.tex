\par The item is a wooden mallet from a "High Striker" carnival game.
A long wooden handle extends from the head.
\par The item infects any organic material with an unknown disease
upon making physical contact. The effects of this disease are
similar to leprosy, but develop at a much faster rate. Within a
matter of days, tissue loss develops in the limbs closest to the
point of infection. While the disease itself has not claimed any
lives, secondary infection has resulted in numerous deaths.
