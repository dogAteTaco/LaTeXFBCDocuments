\par A: Can you tell us why you left your building that day?
\par LM: I was running out to get eggs, there was that corner store on
30th. That's why I left Michael there on his own. Knew I wouldn't
be gone long. He was drawing at the table when I left. Had his
crayons out. Happy. The building came down when I was a block
away. I ran back, started digging. City workers found Mikey later,
beside the fridge. The drawings hadn't come off. Tons of bricks
fall on it and those drawings are still there. How does that
happen?
\par A: You kept the refrigerator after the accident. Why?
\par LM: It still had his drawings. God must have kept them safe for a
reason, right? I'd get home from work and stare at them all night. I
was in a bad way back then.
\par A: Why did you sell the fridge with your son's drawings still on it?
\par WM: They'd gotten stuck to it, or something. I thought about
cutting them off those magnets, but maybe it was better I didn't
hold on to them, you know? Gotta move on, everyone says.
What's my fridge got to do with the building collapse anyhow?
