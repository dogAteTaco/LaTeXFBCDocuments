\subsection*{Waist Mannequin (AI7-KE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The item was last owned by Madame \censor{longest text}, an operatic
performer from Berlin. After her career ended in a public scandal,
she relocated to \censor{longest text}, Maine for reasons unknown. With
her came the trappings of her old life, including this item.
\par Locals report that she rarely left her home in the short years she
spent in \censor{longest text}. After her death (caused by \censor{longest text} \censor{longest text})
the state held a public auction of her belongings,
seeing as she had no known relatives.
\par Various conflicting firsthand reports exist, but testimonies
provided by witnesses of the event do contain some common
elements. Most every witness saw numerous mannequins break
through the house's windows, tumbling outside. Some witnesses
report bright lights. Some report high-pitched singing. These are
unverified. Numerous civilians inside the house at the time of the
incident were hospitalized for various injuries. Two were crushed
to death.
\par Agents were dispatched upon seeing an article regarding these
events during the Bureau's daily scans of national periodicals. The
item was quickly identified and brought to the Bureau.
