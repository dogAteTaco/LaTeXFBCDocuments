\subsection*{SHÜM Arcade Cabinets (AI40-PE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par A distance of 10 feet between the items
suppresses their effect. Effect only
triggers on physical contact.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par Items are a pair of arcade game
cabinets, originally designed for the
games "SHÜM" (AI40:A) and "SHÜM 2:
Culgar's Revenge" (AI40:B). The games were manufactured by
Bon-Co Entertainment, now out of business. Despite being a
popular arcade game in Japan during the late 80s/early 90s, no
other SHUM cabinets have been found by our investigators.
\par When touching one Of the items while it stands within IO feet Of
its counterpart, the user's mind is transported to a version of their
subjective reality that resembles a video game in logic and
function. Events from their everyday lives become game-like
sequences in which speed and efficacy are paramount. The brain
enters a stroke-like state (as proven by EEG studies on users)
which only ends after the user "finishes" their game, at which
point they resume normal brain and motor function.
