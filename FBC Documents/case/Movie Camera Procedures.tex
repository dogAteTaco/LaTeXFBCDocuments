\subsection*{ActionMaxx Camera (AI80-UE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par The item should be isolated from any
person or event that is objectively
interesting since its effect is activated by
the presence of dramatic incidents.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A movie camera used to make
commercial feature films. Internal
mechanisms are unremarkable.
\par Subjects near the item will often experience a "torqued" version
of reality resembling the heightened drama and action of a movie.
Whether these events are localized alternate realities or products
of hallucination is currently unknown.
\par Additionally, the item seems to record footage from these
incidents and creates VHS copies, edited in the style of short
films.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par During their investigation, agents learned that a podcast titled
"Brian's Movie Den" had reviewed the item-generated movie
"Delivery Disaster". The podcast's creator, Brian Hennerman, was
taken for questioning. The staff of Movie Knight, the store Mr.
Hennerman rented the film from, were also questioned to no
effect.
