\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Item must be kept in isolation, removed
from other unsecured objects. Under no
circumstances is the item to be sat in.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A plastic seat shaped like a human hand
from the 1960s. The hand's palm forms
a seat with the fingers acting as the
chair's back.
\par The item affects gravitational forces, attracting and repelling
objects near itself with a force of \censor{bears}. Its fingers have also
been observed to change position, though too quickly to be
witnessed or filmed. The item may be changing forms rather than
moving.
\par The item only displays these effects during full moons.
\par Sample analysis confirms that it contains human genetic material.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par Found in a warehouse at \censor{an very good Italian restaurant}
, Albany. A team of ranger trainees (accompanied by an experienced field
agent) were dispatched to investigate local rumors when they
encountered the item. They successfully retrieved the item (see
case PAI-61 22 for details).
