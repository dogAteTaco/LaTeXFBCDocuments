\subsection*{Bright Falls (AWE-35)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par Alice Wake, Mr. Wake's wife, was found during the Bureau
investigation. She was interviewed and evaluated. She showed
signs of severe mental trauma in the form of \censor{random access}
memory
loss. She was later directed to treatment. It was concluded that
she had been trapped in the Threshold during its manifestation.
\par Notable individuals still missing after the Bright Falls event are FBI
Special Agent Robert Nightingale and Dr. Emil Hartman (refer to
"The Creator's Dilemma" and the file re: the Cauldron Lake
Lodge).
\par Bureau researchers believe this event was the result of a forceful
perception of subjective reality (stemming from Mr. Wake)
overlapping on our own. Wake has been flagged as a potential
parautilitarian (see Prime Candidate Program file for more details).
\par In 2011, a book by Clay Steward titled "The Alan Wake Files" was
published by Roundabout Press (New York and Olympia). Agents
interviewed Clay Steward and suspected minor parautilitarian
sensitivity. He was placed under indefinite surveillance.
\subsubsection*{NOTES:}
\par A monitoring station was established at Cauldron Lake to alert the
Bureau of any future activity.
