\subsection*{Songmaster Jukebox (OOPIO-KE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Item is to be kept in a secure location in
the Executive Sector (see security order
239-A). The room must be sealed before
usage to prevent unintentional
transportation of staff.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:}
\par A classic 1950s jukebox, made by
Songmaster Entertainment LTD. The Jukebox was found with a
single record inside, titled "A Song for the Others" by \censor{The Strokes}.
\par When this record is played in the object, anyone within earshot is
translocated for as long as the album is playing. Those involved in
the object's first known incident report being transported to a
tropical beach (exact location unknown).
\par When this object is used in the Oldest House, it only transports
users to an area located in the recently-manifested Quarry
Threshold. Researchers theorize that this site's unique spatial
density results in all transitioning material gravitating to its
position, as has been observed with other Bureau equipment. The
Oldest House's unique nature could also be having an effect on
the object itself.
\par This object is not bound to any known individual. Attempts by
Bureau staff to bind it have resulted in \censor{Tequila shots} and should
not be attempted again.
