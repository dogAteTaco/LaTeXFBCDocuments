\subsection*{Holiday Memories Tree (AI14-AE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Item must be contained within a
soundproof cell.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A "Holiday Memories" brand white plastic
tree with green plastic stand.
\par The item repeats words and phrases
spoken within a range of \censor{234}
feet, always in a tone below \censor{42984}hz. This verbal mimicry has profoundly distressing effects
on the individual it is copying.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The item was taken from the \censor{Dancing floor},
a Canadian research
station established on Ross Island in Antarctica, where it was
used to celebrate the holiday season. In 1 979, solar radiation
damaged the radio, severing the base's only means of
communication with the world.
\par After the frozen passages opened, a military expedition visited the
base to re-establish contact. They found the base's occupants in
various states of madness, rambling about voices in the tree.
Military personnel discovered they also heard the tree speaking.
After locking the item in a supply crate, they brought it back to the
mainland, at which point the Bureau intervened.
