\subsection*{Ramen Lantern (AI69-KE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The lantern was discovered at a streetside ramen shop in Tokyo,
Japan named \censor{Perez Prado}. The shop gained immense popularity
due to this item, this shining beacon hanging in its doorway. A
visiting documentarian was similarly enthralled by the crimson
luster of the lantern and helped it find international acclaim
through a television series highlighting the world's finest
restaurants. Audience's interest in the lantern brought it to the
attention of the Bureau and soon the lantern found its way here,
to us. I write this as I sit beside the very item. Its light is so
comforting, so familiar. It reminds me of summer nights when I
was a boy. The sun setting, the air warm, the chittering song of
the evening insects. The lantern knows we all want to feel safe, at
home, secure in the knowledge that the world won't change and
neither will we. We'll be young and happy forever, here in its
glow.
