\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par \censor{Super mega the longest text and pages and things}. She was admitted to a mental ward for "emotional instability" soon after
relocating to Illinois with her family in 1 914.
\par The item only appears on record again in 2006 when the Bureau
investigated a sudden rise in disappearances in \censor{longest text}, Illinois. Agents found the item hanging in the local library. They contained it quickly, though the missing people of the town were
never recovered.
\subsubsection*{SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:}
\par DATE: August 18th, 1915
\par We certify that the case of Mrs. \censor{Pepita Perez} has shown her to
be a lunatic under the reasons of Hysteria, Bad Company, and
Imaginary Female Trouble. Her fixation with the family looking
glass is noteworthy, though not an uncommon matter when
considering the female disposition.
\par Mrs. Carver is a fit subject for the lunatic asylum and will remain in
its confines until her affliction has passed.
\par Signed,
\par Dr. \censor{super mega long name yeah}
