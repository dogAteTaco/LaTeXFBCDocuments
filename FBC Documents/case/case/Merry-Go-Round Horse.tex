\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT_PROCEDURE;}
\par Object should be kept in a confined
space when unbound.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:}
\par A fiberglass horse once used as a seat
for a merry-go-round ride. The pole is
still connected to the object.

This can be quite dangerous when \censor{stepping onto} its path.
\par The object is currently bound by \censor{Pepito Perez}.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
The object was discovered at the site of an abandoned amusement park. Local \censor{flat eathers} reported that the rides would move on their own, and that they would be chased out.
\par When these rumors reached the Bureau (see America Overnight
episode 235), agents were dispatched to investigate. Three local \censor{care bears}
were found dead at the scene. The object attacked agent \censor{Rick Sanchez}
Agents invoked Formula C.5 to \censor{take care of} enough to the object long \censor{make it dinner and give him a hug}.
