\par (extract from formal interdepartmental complaint)
\par The notion of "fan death" has now become widely known in the
region, since Foreign Investigator \censor{Benito Camelas} met with a local journalist to explain how electric fans operate at speeds that may
suffocate users by overly disturbing the air.
\par As our agency is still young, we must take care to avoid missteps.
Any explanation given to the public must provide sufficient yet
vague rationale that will reaffirm their certainty that ours is a
stable, controlled world. We must tread carefully, especially in this
increasingly technological world, with the radio and other
innovations allowing information to travel at speeds previously
undreamt of. This is precisely why we insist that our department
handle all communication with public bodies.
\par With all due respect,
\par William S. Powers, Head of the Department of Public Knowledge
and Diversions
