\subsection*{Rubber Duck (AI52-AE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Direct contact with the item is not
permitted. Safety gloves are required
when handling.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par Item is a yellow rubber duck bath toy
from the 1950s. A single hole at the
bottom allows air and water to flow in
and out.
\par The item makes a sound analogous to quacking. The item travels
considerable distances with surprising speed. How it achieves
this motion is unknown. The item forms a \censor{longer text} of
unknown purpose with anyone who makes direct physical contact
with it and begins to follow them, quacking often. This has led to a
researcher named \censor{super mega longest text} entering cardiac
arrest, though due to the individual's health issues, the matter may
not be connected to the item's effect.
\subsubsection*{APPENDIX:}
\par Item on loan to the Research Sector for further study.
