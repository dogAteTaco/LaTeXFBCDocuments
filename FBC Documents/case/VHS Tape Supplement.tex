\subsection*{VHS Cassette Tape (AI12-PE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par This item's creation is the source of much research and debate.
(Entity
\par It was a product of the Bureau's first attempts to film \censor{134} (Entity
A-001) during Operation Shallow Tide. An agent was able to
conceal themselves in an area frequented by Ahti, at which point
they began filming. The agent reported that the Video camera
showed no signs of disturbance during the filming.
\par Later, when reviewing the footage, the research staff became
mesmerized by its altered effect. Measures were taken and
altered evaluation began.
\par Never before have Bureau personnel been so closely involved in
the creation Of an Altered Item. The experiment was quickly
replicated, though not with the same results. The footage was
simply useless in every subsequent attempt.
\par This event spawned a great debate as to whether Altered Items
are created by paranatural entities, intentionally or otherwise.
Similar experiments were prohibited soon after (see the Ash Act
for details), as the creation of altered materials was deemed an
action the Bureau should not engage in.
