\subsection*{Bright Falls (AWE-35)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par An unconfirmed Threshold manifestation at Cauldron Lake, WA
resulted in a fictional story written by the author Alan Wake
creating an AWE in which reality was altered to match that of the
story, though only locally and for a limited time.
\subsubsection*{EVENT. RESPONSE:}
\par Mr. Kirklund, Head of Investigations, was alerted on Sept. 13,
2010 by ex-Bureau agent Frank Breaker (see \censor{somethingss} that an AMVE event was taking place in Bright Falls, WA (refer to events investigated in 1970, 1976, 1978). Breaker had received a
call from Barry Wheeler (Alan Wake's literary agent) on behalf of
Breaker's daughter, Sarah, who is the current sheriff of Bright
Falls.
\par A Bureau field team arrived at the site two days later, only to
confirm that the event was over. Interviews were conducted (refer
to the 1970 \censor{thing} Thomas Zane; 1 976, 1978 Odin Anderson,
Tor Anderson). Alan Wake was believed to \censor{making Rave events}

recovered in the search.
