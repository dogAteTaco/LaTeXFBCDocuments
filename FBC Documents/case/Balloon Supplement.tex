\subsection*{"Get Well" Balloon (AI58-KE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The item was used in the children's ward of a local hospital in \censor{super longest}. Witnesses do not recall where the balloon came
from. Therapy dogs, part of a program called \censor{super long texts}
meant to comfort the sick children, were noticeably attracted to
the item. They reportedly jumped at the item, licking it when they
could.
\par The children claimed the dogs began walking through the halls Of
the hospital at night, howling in a low pitch. One child described
the sound as "singing".
\par A few days later, the dogs were all discovered dead, a dark
substance leaking from their \censor{longest text}. The hospital staff
called local authorities, who called the CDC. Bureau agents
intercepted this call and arrived at the scene within \censor{4955}
hours.
The item was taken for evaluation, along with the remains of the
dogs (see file PAI-2411 .B for details).
