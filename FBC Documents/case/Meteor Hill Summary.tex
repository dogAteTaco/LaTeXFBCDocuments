\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par This Paradimensional Occurrence consisted of three sequential
sinkholes induced by subterranean implosions revealing foreign
material of magmatic qualities.
\subsubsection*{EVENT RESPONSE:}
\par A local chapter of the Youth Science League were participating in
an archeological dig on the hill when the event occurred. Many
boys were injured in the resulting collapse. Some touched the
magma directly.
\par Bureau agents arrived at the scene seven days after the incident.
Samples of the lava-like material were taken. The area was quickly
sealed off from the public at our recommendation. Our aim was to
ensure all remnants of the material were rendered inoffensive but
the magma descended too deeply into the earth to retrieve. Foul-
smelling odors were detected in the area, which were
hypothesized being the dissipated element's vapor trail left at the
scene.
\par All acquired material was delivered to Washington for examination
in the Bureau's onsite laboratories.
