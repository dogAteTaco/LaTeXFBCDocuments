\par \censor{BOB}: I experienced confidence! Cranked all the way up. I wanted
to become somebody. An artist, a stock trader.

That shit was mine. I would have taken it all. Money, fame,
women-

\par \censor{BOB}: Yes! Increased everything! I've been cleaning shit for you
people long enough! I'm going out on a fucking conquest!
