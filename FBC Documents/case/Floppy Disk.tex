\subsection*{Floppy Disk (OOP5-KE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Must be contained in a cell with no other
loose material.
\subsubsection*{
	\par The object is an 8 inch diskette
	containing Soviet-era nuclear launch
	codes.
	\par When bound, the object allows parautilitarians to telekinetically lift
	material and throw it a short distance (see Dr. Darling
	presentation 11.15 for more information).
	\par The object is currently bound to \censor{very super long text}
	research purposes.
	\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
	\par Stolen from a Soviet military base located in \censor{short text}
	by agents \censor{Rosa Mesta y Rosa Meltrozo} and \censor{Pepito Jr.} with the CIA. The
	diskette contained launch codes to \censor{russian} missiles, believed to
	be reserved for use against \censor{beliebers}. After being returned to
	America, the diskette began throwing computational hardware at
	members of the decoding team. An informant in the CIA tipped
	the Bureau off and it was requisitioned by agents the next day.
