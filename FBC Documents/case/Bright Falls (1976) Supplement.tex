\subsection*{Bright Falls (AWE-1O)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par On the day of the flooding, the rock band Old Gods of Asgard
was rehearsing in a field outside the Anderson Farm, the
homestead of band members Odin and Tor Anderson. Both
admitted to being in a heavy state of inebriation at the time, having
spent "days" drinking their home-brewed moonshine while
celebrating Deerfest.
\par After the townspeople were evacuated from the flooded field,
Sheriff Breaker was asked by Freya Anderson, daughter of Tor
Anderson, to check on her father and uncle. Breaker drove to the
Anderson Farm and found the band members alive but in need of
medical aid. Tor Anderson had been struck by lightning and Odin
Anderson had cut out his own right eye (a possible ref. to Norse deities
\censor{Luke} and \censor{Linus}?). They claimed they had fought and
"valiantly defeated" a "dark army of the scratching hag" rising from
Cauldron Lake (see AWE-\censor{423} of 1970, related to the suspected \censor{super long texts}
at Diver's Isle).
\par While impossible to verify, these events are relevant to the
recurring AVVE at Bright Falls and the Cauldron Lake \censor{very long text}. Odin and Tor Anderson have been listed as
persons of interest.
