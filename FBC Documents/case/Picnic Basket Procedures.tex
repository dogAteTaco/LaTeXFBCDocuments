\subsection*{Bremen Basket (AI54-UE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Item to be stored in a Black Rock
panelled cell. Keep away from lab
animals when not in use.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A simple wicker basket with cloth lining.
No food items inside.
\par The item produces a hypnotic effect that solely affects non-
human animals, forcing them to congregate passively around the
object. Animals from every genus and species that have thus far
been tested are susceptible. Single-cell organisms do not appear
to react to the effect.
\subsubsection*{APPENDIX:}
\par 6/97 â€” Item was taken to a forest upstate for testing. Results of
the test provided contradicting data as some of the attracted
animals exhibited hyper-aggressive behavior. The exercise
unfortunately resulted in \censor{super mega longest texts} \censor{longer text}.
Further testing should be restricted to more low-risk animal
species with medical staff on standby.
