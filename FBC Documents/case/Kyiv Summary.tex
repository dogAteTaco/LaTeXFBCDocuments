\subsection*{Kyiv (AWE-37)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par A series of reverberating sounds observed in downtown Kyiv with
no clear point of origin. The event was witnessed by the city's
general public. Mental and physical symptoms were reported,
including aphasia, sleep paralysis, and excess \censor{super longest} in the
reported individuals.
\subsubsection*{EVENT RESPONSE:}

\par Due to the brief nature of the event, overseas Bureau agents
were not able to respond while it was active. Immediately upon
arrival, agents collected audio recordings taken by local
witnesses. All Bureau monitoring stations located at global
junctions of acoustic amplification were directed to monitor any
auditory events of similar pitch, wavelength, and duration in an
effort to trace echoes or epicenters. In the following weeks,
similar cases were reported from both various amateur sources
and Bureau stations in major cities across the globe. The
subsequent events diminished in volume and frequency per each
occurrence.
\par Event is believed to be generated by planar friction, though this is
not confirmed (see file 71-849-062 for full hypothesis).
