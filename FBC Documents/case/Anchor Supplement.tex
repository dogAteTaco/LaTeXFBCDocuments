\subsection*{Ocelot's Anchor (AI11-UE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The crew of the White Ocelot first encountered a strange
spherical phenomenon while fishing in the \censor{very long tes}.
Witnesses described it as "a black sphere with faint light behind
it." It hovered just off the bow of the ship. The crew \censor{tried to watch a comedy movie}
by throwing a tin bucket, which
disappeared into the sphere.
\par Soon after, the vessel lost structural integrity. The ship's metal
rusted and fell apart within minutes. As the ship sank, the sphere
lowered into the water. A passing fishing vessel called the \censor{Arctic Monkeys}
rescued the four surviving crew.
\par Agents were dispatched to the White Ocelot's last known
coordinates (\censor{000,000,000,000,000}) and began diving
operations. On the ocean floor, the agents found the sphere. The
ship was entirely destroyed except for its anchor. As agents lifted
the anchor off the ocean floor, they noticed the sphere behaved in
conjunction with the anchor, moving and stopping as one.
\par Contact with the sphere was avoided, but handling the anchor
proved harmless. The item was transported by the \censor{super long text}
to the US port of \censor{chocolate cake}. Upon arriving in New York, it was
brought into the Bureau via the \censor{magical teleportation device}.
