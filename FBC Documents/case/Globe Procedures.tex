\subsection*{Wolff Globe (AI72-PE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par No unique procedures required.
However, contact should be limited, as
some report feeling disoriented after
touching it.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par Item is handmade, set in dark wood. The
item itself is lacquered, hand-painted,
spins freely on all axes. While the continents and oceans are
recognizably those of Earth, careful examination has revealed
numerous \censor{very mega long text test} and other geographic
additions that do not exist on our planet. One of these islands has
a city marked on it, named "Tan Relio". There are no signatures
left by its maker.
\par Physical contact renders subjects dizzy and disoriented, with
some reporting a feeling of unfamiliarity with their surroundings.
This effect seems to grow worse with prolonged contact,
culminating in a sense of listlessness and depression. Suicide
has been observed in \censor{1234}
handlers.
