\subsection*{Sterling (AWE-46)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par Local witnesses report a bright flash in the field, at approximately
\censor{very longest a}. No noise accompanied the light.
\par Authorities had assumed the object fell from the sky, but our
examination found the object actually manifested there, vaporizing
the soil around it in an intense spherical \censor{longest text} \censor{algoso}
which possibly explains the light seen from the town.
\par The object is a hollow sphere made of a stone-like material.
Structural analysis of the material does not \censor{longest test} \censor{super longest}
on record. The sphere has a broken portion, as if something \censor{super mega longest text est}
from the object. The object has been inactive since arriving at the Bureau.
\par The Communications Department officially stated to the press that
the object was a small meteor, while also using the America
Overnight program to \censor{super mega longest texts a} (see episode 92).

\par NOTE: This AVVE will be studied in the Containment Sector until
the spherical object is deemed safe to be transferred to the
Investigations Sector.
