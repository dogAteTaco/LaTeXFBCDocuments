\subsection*{Fra Mauro (AWE-7)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par A paranatural entity arrived on Earth by infiltrating the Apollo 14
lunar mission at an unknown point of their voyage to the Fra
Mauro highlands of the Moon.
\subsubsection*{EVENT RESPONSE:}
\par 32 hours after the return of the Apollo 14 command module to
Earth, the Bureau was contacted by Mr. \censor{Perez Prado}, a White
House senior official, and instructed to send a small team to the
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
\par At the base, the team examined the entity and carried out
interviews with NASA staff. They learned that four astronauts had
returned to Earth instead of the expected three. Each human
crewmember was insistent that the mission left with four
members, though they couldn't name the fourth when asked. The
entity seemingly affected their memory to make its presence feel
unremarkable.
\par The entity was transported to the Oldest House for further
investigation.
\par NOTE: An altercation between NASA security and the
investigation team occurred upon their arrival. Mr. \censor{long namest t}
called to clarify the matter, though tensions remained high.
Bureau jurisdiction and clearance should be defined more clearly
with other federal agencies.
