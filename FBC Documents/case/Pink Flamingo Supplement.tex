\subsection*{Pink Flamingo (AI46-KE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par Agents noticed a transient commonly found outside the entrance
of the Bureau headquarters would carry the item and loudly claim
to be responsible for the lack of inclement weather. The
frequency of these claims attracted the personal interest of Dr.
Darling.
\par In interviews disguised as casual conversations, the transient
reported that the item "gives me clouds when it's hot and sun
when it's not." An event of note occurred during a heavy
downpour when the vagrant was witnessed performing a possible
ritual with the item (see file PAI-1372 for a detailed observation)
Dr. Darling reported a wait of \censor{478}
seconds before the rain
stopped.
\par The vagrant was seized the next day. After \censor{longest tes test}, he
was found to possess no \censor{longest text} and was released. The
item remains in Bureau custody under suspicion of altered status,
though this still has not been proven. All known variations of
Identification Formulas have failed to elicit a response from the
item.
