\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par No unique procedures required.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par Item is made of fiberglass, painted to
resemble a swan. Foot pedals allow the
item to propel forward in water.
\par The item emits a pulse of physical force
at an estimated force of \censor{very super longest text}
(possible connection to OOP5?). Measuring the exact force created by the
item has been hindered by concerns from the Human Resources
Dept.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The item was seized from an activity rental service called \censor{very longest textex}
located on Lake \censor{very longest} on Vancouver Island, Canada after it ejected numerous riders over
the course of a summer, bringing the boat to the attention of the
media.
\par The item was transported to the Bureau by helicopter. A
containment specialist accompanied it, sent to recite Formulas
C.9 through 32 recursively. What occurred in the helicopter is not
known, but all agents were lost in the crash. The item was
recovered and then transported by train. It arrived at the Bureau
without further incident.
