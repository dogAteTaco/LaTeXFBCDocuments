\subsection*{Rubber Duck (AI52-AE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par Discovered in the home of Agent \censor{super longest}
after his young daughter complained of being followed by her rubber duck.
According to Agent \censor{Alex Turner}, the matter was ignored,
believed to be the result of a child's imagination, until he began to
hear the quacking at night.
\par After discovering the item hiding in his daughter's closet, he
brought it to the Bureau for study.
\par UPDATE: It was discovered that Agent \censor{Jackie Chan}
was bringing known paranatural materials into his home, illegally taking
them outside the Oldest House. How this may have affected the
creation of an Altered Item is being investigated. Agent \censor{Corey Taylor}
has been terminated.
