\subsubsection*{SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:}
\par (article from the Toronto Daily)
\par "So why would a 36-year-old Bay Street investment trader, filthy
rich, married to a model, disappear overnight? That's the question
that's kept Toronto high society up at night this past week. Police
say it's being looked into, some nut job radio show in the States
claims he disappeared to join the Illuminati, but it's this reporter's
opinion that Mr. Wolff, bored of his job, sick of his family, left it all
behind to retire in some remote beach paradise. Now he's sipping
Mai Tais while the world thinks he's dead."
