\subsection*{Jasper Post Box (AI31-PE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par Agents arrived in the town of Jasper Crossing, Arizona after the
communications department intercepted multiple phone calls to
local authorities regarding "frozen people" in the streets. Four of
the five dispatched agents became paralyzed upon arriving at the
scene. Additional assessment teams were dispatched.
\par Variations of Identification Formulas were tried with ineffectual
results. Agents resorted to using aerial photography to study the
positioning of the paralyzed individuals. Soon after, agents
discovered the event's "epicenter" to be the local post office.
\par Unaffected agents cleared the area of all paralyzed civilians,
animals, and Bureau personnel before beginning to study the
item. Agents deemed susceptible to the item were tasked with
interviewing and re-informing the public away from the site.
\par The item was soon placed on a transport vehicle manned by
unaffected agents. Air travel had been deemed too dangerous
given the item's effect. Numerous reports of temporary paralysis
were reported by civilians along the truck's route from Arizona to
New York City.
