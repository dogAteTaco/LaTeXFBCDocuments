\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A ceramic "beckoning cat" figurine,
common luck object found in Japanese
storefronts.
\par The following is a list of the item(s)
observed altered effects: Non-corporeality, affinity for specific
human behavior, and minor physical movement (waving its arm).
\par Multiple simultaneous incarnations of this item have been
observed. Whether these are independent Altered Items acting
uniformly or replicated instances of A148 is unknown.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par How the item(s) originally arrived in the Oldest House is unknown.
It was first discovered sitting in the Director's chair and was
immediately contained in a Panopticon cell. The next day, an agent
noticed two additional figurines had appeared. Hours later, all
three vanished. The item(s) has been sighted throughout the
Bureau, appearing while agents perform \censor{super longest}
tasks. It is
theorized that fulfilling certain unknown criteria will encourage the
item(s) to appear.
\par Present location is unknown.
