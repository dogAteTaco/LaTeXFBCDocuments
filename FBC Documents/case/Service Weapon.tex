\subsection*{Service Weapon (OOPI-KE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par No unique procedures required.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:}
The object's form is variable.
When bound, the object allows
parautilitarians to \censor{shoot things}. This object must only be bound by individuals seeking the role of \censor{the Director of the FBC}. The object will determine whether \censor{they have enough social credits}. If
rejected, the applicant is terminated. This process is dictated by
the \censor{Astral Board}, though their criteria is unknown.
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par The object was discovered inside the Oldest House, in the room
that is now used as the Director's Office. The popular hypothesis \censor{the Service Weapon has changed to} many forms throughout history, \censor{putting itself into position of power}. Mjolnir, Excalibur, Varunastra, all weapons that \censor{enhances the paranormal abilities} of their wielders. If Objects of Power are the convergence of
forces based on the collective subconscious, then this may be
the original manifestation of that event. If this is the case, \censor{then sponges can fly} (see Dr. Darling presentation 11.1 for more
details).
