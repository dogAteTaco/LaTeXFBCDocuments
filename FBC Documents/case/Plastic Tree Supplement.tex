\par (Excerpt from "Altered Speech of AI14" by Dr. Theodore Ash)
\par "The results are incredible, but more so the speed of discovery
this allows us. AI14 copies our speech, but after numerous tests
we've discovered that certain words are missing from its
vocabulary. We began isolating these words, cross-referencing
them with esoteric texts from the early days of the Bureau. We
found that these words, when arranged in particular formations
and spoken at varying speeds and cadences, elicit a reaction from
altered materials.
\par We tested this specific string of words, a "Formula" if you will, on
the other Altered Items kept in the Examination Hall. Varying
physical responses were recorded with each one, with an 82\%
success rate. We've proven that words can tangibly affect these
items. Specific applications must be explored, possibly for
containment or identification purposes. This will drastically change
our approach moving forward.
\par And to think, there are still more words to be found!"
