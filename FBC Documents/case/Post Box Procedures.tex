\subsection*{Jasper Post Box (AI31-PE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Black Rock panelling has proven
effective in hindering, but not eliminating
the object's altered effect. Agents in the
immediate vicinity may still experience
paralysis. Keeping a distance of \censor{a very longer}
feet from the cell is
recommended unless agent is confirmed
to be non-susceptible.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT;}
\par A dark blue United States post box, model \censor{texts}.
Paint is
chipped at the edges. The item itself is empty, with no mail
discovered inside at the time of retrieval.
\par The item seizes the motor functions of organisms meeting an
unknown criteria. Paralyzed subjects are still capable of moving
their eyes and limited speech. During tests, approximately 16\% of
agents remained unaffected by the item. Age, gender, race,
height, weight, blood type, eye color, clothing, place of birth, diet,
heart rate, and socioeconomic standing are all factors proven to
have no correlation to an individual's vulnerability to the item.
Victim's states of mind were recorded during onset of paralysis,
but no emotional correlation has yet been found.
