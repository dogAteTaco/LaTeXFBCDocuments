\subsection*{The Eagle Limited (AWE-44)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par A train derailment resulting in 62 casualties and numerous injuries
was suspected to have been the work of a paracriminal group
known as \censor{very long text}. As a result of this event, the agents
discovered that one of the cars had become altered with a
persistent auditory event. It remains to be determined whether the
AWE was spontaneous or the direct result of the sabotage.
\subsubsection*{EVENT RESPONSE:}
\par The Bureau had been tracking said group at the time and the intel
gathered suggested an event of this caliber was imminent in
Bloomington. As a result, a response team on site was able to
respond to the train accident site within minutes of its
occurrence. They arrived to find emergency processes underway,
but also equipment left behind by the suspected group. A
suspicious onlooker managed to elude agents after they
attempted to make contact.
\par Further investigation of the accident site revealed a curiously
undamaged train car that exhibited an altered state when entered.
This individual car was secured and transported to the
Investigations Sector for further studies.
