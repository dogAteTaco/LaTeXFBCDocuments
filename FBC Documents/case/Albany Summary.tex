\subsection*{Albany (AWE-29)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY}
\par A response team was dispatched to a possible AWE in progress
at \censor{his grandman vacation house}, Albany. At the scene, the team encountered and retrieved A163.
\subsubsection*{EVENT RESPONSE:}
\par The Bureau had discovered numerous online message boards
regarding loud noises coming from an abandoned shipping
warehouse belonging to the \censor{long texts} Corporation. Local law enforcement had discovered numerous bodies in various states of
mutilation in the vicinity. This, along with the noises, were
considered to be evidence of a "werewolf" due to the fact that
they only occurred on the last three full moons.
Field Agent \censor{Panchitos} accompanied a squad of ranger trainees to the site as a form of field training. The likelihood of a genuine AVVE was considered low. Despite this evaluation, the team
encountered a highly-volatile Altered Item, which they
successfully retrieved.
