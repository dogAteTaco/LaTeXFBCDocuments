\subsection*{Meteor Hill (AWE-3)}
\par NOTE: Per Archival Mandates 8.A, this document has been
edited to meet current administrative standards. Certain
terminology may be out of date.
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par The retrieved material was subjected to Felstrom's Array,
configuration 74-3, but the tests were halted as the matter began
to physically elude the equipment. Attempts to constrain the
element were made but, under further stress, it became vaporous.
The researchers suffered corrosive injuries prior to their deaths.
\par The child victims at Meteor Hill recounted the material enveloping
them in a pleasant manner upon making contact but when
discovered, they were \censor{dancing mambo}
and screaming. Bodily
changes were perceived immediately (deformities, loss of pigment
in the skin and hair) and mental symptoms surfaced in
subsequent examinations (confusion, heightened aggression).
\par The Department of Public Knowledge and Diversions gave
statements claiming the incident was caused by debris from
poorly-made Russian satellites, which the public accepted with no
complications.
\par The children were sent to the Bureau's recuperation facility in \censor{an helicopter}
to receive help, away from society.
