\subsection*{Typewritten Page (AI83-KE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par No unique procedures required.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A standard letter-size typewritten page
with minor water damage. The page is
full of text, but apart from the top seven
lines, all the rest has been violently
scratched out. Only a few individual
words and phrases can be made out.
\par The page emits a dim glow in the dark. When the text is read,
there is a feeling Of dislocation, as if witnessing the page being
written as you read it and as if reality around you was being \censor{long text}
to match the words on the page. This feeling is made
stronger if the text is \censor{longer}.
\par Forensic and linguistic analysis confirm that the text has been
written by Alan Wake With the same typewriter as the earlier
materials discovered in Bright Falls in 2010 (see Bright Falls
AWE case file for information).
