\subsection*{Bright Falls (AWE-1O)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par An unconfirmed Threshold manifestation occurred at Cauldron
Lake, WA.
\par The citizens of Bright Falls had gathered in the town's
southwestern fields for the annual festival known as Deerfest.
Eyewitnesses all claim that the day had been sunny, confirmed by
reviews of the area's weather reports, but then, with no warning,
a thunderstorm appeared in the direction of the Anderson Farm
and a tornado rose from Cauldron Lake. The torrential rain that
followed caused a flash flood.
\par "It was as if the day had turned to night." â€”testimony from \censor{very long text.}
\par Frank Breaker, the Sheriff of Bright Falls (formerly a Bureau
Agent, see employee file \censor{longss text}, managed to guide the
crowd to safety as the festival grounds were destroyed by the
flood. The festival was cancelled, ending one day early.
\par Lack of official Bureau presence on the scene makes this event
difficult to report as a confirmed AVVE, though the similarity to
other known events in the Bright Falls area lend credence to the
accounts of the townspeople.
