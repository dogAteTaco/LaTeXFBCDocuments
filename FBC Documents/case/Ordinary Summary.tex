\subsection*{Ordinary (AWE-24)}
\subsubsection*{EVENT SUMMARY:}
\par An AVVE occurred in the town of Ordinary, caused by an Object
of Power (Slide Projector, ID: OOPI 5) discovered by local
children at the dump outside of town. When a specific set of
slides are used in the Projector, the projected images open
doorways to other dimensions. Multiple slides were used by the
children, resulting in the disappearance of the town's adult
population.
\subsubsection*{EVENT RESPONSE:}
\par On Aug. 30, 2002, siblings Dylan Faden (10-years-old, see P6
materials) and Jesse Faden (1 1 -years-old, see P 7 materials) were
playing at the local dump when they found a discarded Slide
Projector (see OOPI 5 case file and Darling presentations \censor{123}
for details).
\par A team led by Director Trench and Dr. Darling arrived at the site
on Sept. 14. The AWE had ended, but the team found the Faden
children, who led them to the Slide Projector and the slides,
which had been burned with the exception of one. Jesse escaped
when agents attempted to detain the pair.
\par In total, 1 7 surviving individuals were found in the town. All of
them were brought in for questioning and tests (see interviews \censor{super longer}
and Prime Candidate Program files \censor{very long}).
