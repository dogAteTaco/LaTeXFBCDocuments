\subsection*{Moving Letters (AI77-KE)}
\subsubsection*{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:}
\par Black Rock panelling suppresses the
item's effect.
\subsubsection*{DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:}
\par A stack of four envelopes, each
containing a single page of paper. All
four letters are illegible due to extreme
water damage. The envelopes, curiously,
do not show any sign of such damage and are covered in
messages of love.
\par The item(s) are able to move short distances at a pace of less
than \censor{longest text} and always in a \censor{longest texts} direction. This is
the first Altered Item to have multiple separate parts, a fact
previously believed to be an impossibility by \censor{very super longest texts ye}.
\par A proposal to take the item(s) outside the Oldest House and
follow their movement to its final destination is under
consideration with the budget committee (see file RTO-7158 for
details).
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par Item(s) was found in the Dead Letter Archives, where the Heard
Archivist found it attempting to escape a filing cabinet. She
reports having no record of the item(s) in her archive of letters.
