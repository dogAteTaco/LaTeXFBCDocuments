\subsection*{Fra Mauro (AWE-7)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par The Apollo 14 entity (commonly known as "Fra") underwent a
series of physical examinations upon its admittance into the
Oldest House.
\par The entity can speak, though its poor grasp of the English
language makes any meaningful communication impossible.
Interview material can be found at \censor{longer texts}.
\par Its physical form consists solely of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit
(EMU) spacesuit used by NASA astronauts, the same model worn
by the other crew. This could be an authentic EMU taken from
one of the NASA astronauts (though this suit does not bear any
wearer's name) or one materialized through \censor{longer texts}
conversion or possibly \censor{longest text}
corporealization. The suit itself
is slightly damaged, which is likely due to the fact that the
command module did not have a fourth seat for the entity to strap
into during re-entry.
\par The EMU is entirely hollow and pieces can be removed, though
this seems to agitate the entity. X-rays and spectrograph imaging
have shown \censor{giant donut}-shaped outlines existing within the suit.
For safety reasons, the entity will be contained in a secure cell
until more information can be gathered.
