\subsection*{Ordinary (AWE-24)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par Details are largely based on interviews conducted with Dylan
Faden (see interviews \censor{super long textss} and \censor{longestes}
for relevant information) and the obtained therapy sessions of Jesse Faden, as
well as circumstantial evidence found at the Ordinary site. Note
that accounts provided by all three sources contain conflicting
data. Example: D.F. claims there were eight slides for the
projector. J.F. mentioned nine slides. The Bureau found one intact
slide (designation: 36) and the burnt remains of six others.
Unfortunately, these slides are too badly damaged to be used in
the Projector.
\par Jesse Faden is believed to be the individual responsible for
burning the slides.
\subsubsection*{NOTES:}
\par Dr. Darling has ordered that the entirety of the Ordinary town
dump be brought to the Bureau for examination and analysis, with
the hopes of finding additional slides or other altered materials.
\par Due to the limited space in the Investigations Sector, this AWE
will be investigated in the Containment Sector.
