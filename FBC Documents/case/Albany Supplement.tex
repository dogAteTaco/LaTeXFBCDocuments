\subsection*{Albany (AWE-29)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par Upon arrival, the squad broke into the warehouse and discovered
boxes of undelivered merchandise abandoned by the previous
owner of the warehouse. As they investigated the noise, \censor{they noticed dancers yeah} along the south side of the building caused it to collapse inward. Wooden crates in accelerated
physical \censor{maximum damage} from \censor{dancing} rendered Field Agent \censor{Pepito Jones} and two of the trainees unconscious. The others escaped the warehouse before it collapsed entirely. In the rubble, they found A163 at the origin of the \censor{backup dancer yey text}, attracting and repelling debris.
\par They stood guard around the item until the moon set, at which
point the altered effect ceased. They returned the item to the
Bureau without further incident. No fatalities occurred.
\par The collapse of the warehouse was not witnessed by civilians and thus no re-informing by the Communications Department was
required.
