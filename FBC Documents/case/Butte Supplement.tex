\subsection*{Butte (AWE-17)}
\subsubsection*{DETAILS:}
\par According to their testimony, the agents had been transported
from the Butte home to a roadside motel (named the Oceanview
Motel and Casino) and discovered a room key by performing a
ritual (see file MOT-OI). The key opened a door marked with an
inverted black pyramid, which they only learned after a lengthy
period of trial and error. After pulling another motel cord found
inside this room, they were transported to the Oldest House.
\par The disappearances of the home's owner and the other locals of
Butte have been attributed to the light switch cord. The Oceaniew
Motel is now known to have many doors and pathways.
\par Since the occurrence, identical light switch cords to the one
found in the Butte home have begun appearing throughout the
Oldest House. At the time of writing, \censor{word}
light cords have been found in the Oldest House, located in the \censor{super very long text tt}, and \censor{very long text} Sectors. These all access the Oceanview Motel, though how exactly this link
operates is \censor{very long text} but initial hypotheses center on the Butte AVME as a \censor{very very long text} \censor{long texts} (see Dr. Darling presentation 24.3 for more details).
