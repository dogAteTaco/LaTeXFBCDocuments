\subsection*{SHÃœM Arcade Cabinets (AI40-PE)}
\subsubsection*{BACKGROUND:}
\par Both items were purchased from a closing arcade in \censor{longer texts}
Michigan as part of a program to improve employee wellbeing
through recreation. The program was cancelled before any game
machines were dispersed throughout the Oldest House, but not
before these Altered Items were discovered.
\subsubsection*{SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:}
\par Teams in the Research Sector have voiced considerable interest
in the items due to the fact that they only exhibit an altered effect
when physically paired together, a codependent relationship
previously unseen in Altered Items (see Research Specialist
Pope's paper titled "The Parasensitivity of Sequels" for more
information).
\par However, after proving the items' altered status, the Investigations
staff insisted on keeping them, claiming that they are important for
sector morale. To date, numerous petitions have been filed by
Research Sector personnel to move the items there for more
extensive analysis.
