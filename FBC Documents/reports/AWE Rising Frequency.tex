\subsection*{PROCESSES AND BEST PRACTICES\\	AWE FREQUENCY}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par For some time now there has been a steady increase in the
annual number of AVVEs that the Bureau responds to. Between
2010 and 2015 we responded to \censor{long text es} AWEs. For comparison, note that we only responded to \censor{long text long} between 1995 and 2005.
\par Is this rise a result of \censor{super mega ultra long text}, improvement in
our detection procedures, or perhaps simply coincidence? We
cannot say for sure, which is why this proposal for an AWE Task
Force to be created within the hierarchy of the Investigations
Sector has been compiled. We need to spend more time
examining what \ul{causes} AWEs rather than just containing them.
