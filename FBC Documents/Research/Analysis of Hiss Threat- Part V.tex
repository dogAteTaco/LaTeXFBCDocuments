\subsection*{ANALYSIS OF HISS THREAT: PART V\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Hiss corruption manifests in vastly different ways. Some hosts
remain largely unchanged, while others are barely recognizable as
human. What determines this level of alteration? Is it the duration
of corruption? It could simply be an evolutionary process, each
entity representing a stage of growth in an undiscovered linear
progression leading towards. .. what?
\par Additionally, Hiss entities possess various paranatural abilities.
How have they achieved this? Do they gain them from corrupting
Objects of Power? Have they corrupted a single highly-talented
parautilitarian and divided their access to paranatural abilities
across the network of Hiss-corrupted hosts?
\par As a scientist, I am hindered by the sheer number of questions.
It's difficult to identify where one should begin. What is the most
pertinent question?
\par How do we kill it? That seems like a good start.
