\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS CORRUPTED RANGER\\
	(AIRBORNE)\\
	CONFIDENTIAL}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par This subgroup of Hiss-corrupted
Rangers has manifested the ability to
levitate, similarly to Hiss Elevated
Agents. However, these airborne Hiss
Rangers display no telekinetic abilities
and simply continue to use mundane Bureau weaponry.
\par This evolution, being so similar to the Elevated, possibly indicates
that Hiss can "share" permutations through a type of network or
perhaps osmosis. However, the fact that this development in Hiss
Rangers has only been observed in the Investigations Sector may
indicate that an environmental factor is responsible. They could be
responding to an Altered Item or other paranatural element found
only in that sector. Or perhaps this is the natural progression of
the Hiss Ranger phenotype. Not enough time has passed to
determine a conclusive trajectory of development for each of the
Hiss manifestations, assuming any such trajectory exists.
