\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS CORRUPTED RANGER\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par The Rangers are the Bureau's well-
trained and well-armed expeditionary
forces. Their Hiss-corrupted
counterparts are equally formidable.
\par Prior to corruption, Rangers were trained
to use a variety of weapons in order to face any threat found
during AWE response or Threshold exploration, including sub-
machine guns, assault rifles, and automatic shotguns. Hiss
Rangers utilize these weapons as well as the advanced tactics
taught by Bureau instructors. Some are additionally outfitted with
Bureau-made body armor. Hiss Rangers have no observed
paranatural abilities beyond some being protected by a shielding
of dense Hiss resonance, capable of stopping bullets.
\par Considering the advanced training the Hiss Rangers are capable
of applying to their situation, is it feasible to consider the human
mind still remains intact to some degree? Or is the Hiss able to
tap into this combat training and utilize it? Further observation is
required.
