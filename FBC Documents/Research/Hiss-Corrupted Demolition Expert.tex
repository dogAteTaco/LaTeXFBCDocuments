\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS-CORRUPTED DEMOLITION\\
	EXPERT\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par The Bureau only allows certain highly-
trained individuals to handle volatile
materials and weaponry. Our demolition
experts are instructed in the use of
explosives in dimensions with distinct
physical laws, making them important assets for engineering work
as well as combat situations.
\par Hiss Demolition Experts are the only observed Hiss variations to
wield the specially-built rocket propelled grenade that is designed
to identify and track \censor{corrupted}
entities once fired, making them a
threat whose termination should be prioritized in combat
scenarios.
\par I find it remarkable that the Hiss restrict usage of this weapon to
the Bureau personnel who trained specifically for its use. What
does this tell us about its behavior? Can it not pass along new
information to corrupted entities? Still too many unknowns.
