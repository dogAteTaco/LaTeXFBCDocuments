\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS SHARPENED AGENT\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Hiss Sharpened Agents display the
parautilitarian ability to rapidly move short
distances. This ability is unique in the
fact that it's not associated with any
known Object of Power. However, we
should not discount the possibility that
this ability is an Object variation. For example, Abrupt Physical
\par Relocation (APR) could potentially be a variant of the Jukebox's
effect. Other explanations of the Hiss Sharpened's ability
currently include:
\par a) Momentary time manipulation
\par b) Brief increase in physical speed
\par c) Inhibiting the witness' sense of sight
\par If we do accept that the Hiss Sharpened's ability is not connected
to a known Object of Power, then the Hiss are either manifesting
unique paranatural abilities or there are Objects in the House that
we aren't aware of. Either way, the Hiss are continuing to develop
new strains of corruption and that is cause for concern.
