\subsection*{ANALYSIS OF HISS THREAT: PART III\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par If we understand the Hiss to be a force based on vibration and
resonance, then perhaps their incantation (which is now the
agreed upon term for their vocalizations) is an effort to express
that resonance using human vocal cords and speech. Would
there be differences if the incantation were recited in a different
language?
\par The most common word used is "want". Interestingly, every usage
of the word is attributed to a "you". "You want to listen", "you want
this to be true", "you must want these waves to drag you away."
Are we the "you" the Hiss are referring to? Does the Hiss believe
humanity, possibly all non-Hiss life, wants to join it? To be
consumed by it? Is that its goal?
\par The second most used words are "through" and "time". Is this
possibly the Hiss stating how they arrived here? Or an indication
of its age?
There is clear intention in the words. Dismissing the incantation
as "nonsense", as some of my colleagues recommend, is beyond
idiotic.
