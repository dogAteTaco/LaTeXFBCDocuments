\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS CLUSTER\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Hiss Clusters are unique in that they are
concentrated manifestations of Hiss
resonance without the need of a host.
\par Hiss Clusters are dense spherical
compressions of Hiss resonance that
serve support functions in the hierarchy of Hiss entities. The
Clusters are capable of replenishing Hiss hosts with infusions of
resonance. This does not heal any physical damage inflicted on
the organic host, but rather seems to rejuvenate them, allowing
them to endure more bodily harm than normally possible.
\par The fact that the Hiss makes an effort to preserve its corrupted
hosts underlines a level of awareness and discretion that was
previously just speculation on my part. Can this entity be
considered an individual or simply an extension of the Hiss as a
whole? Capturing one "alive" would be quite interesting.
