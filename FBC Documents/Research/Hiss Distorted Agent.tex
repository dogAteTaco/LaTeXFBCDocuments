\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS DISTORTED AGENT\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Hiss Distorted Agents are able to render
themselves invisible and emit a powerful
concussive blast when in close range of
their target. Curiously, the Hiss Distorted
is apparently not able to utilize both
abilities at once. It must make itself
visible when it goes on the offensive.

\par The Hiss Distorted is unique in the fact that it wields a paranatural
ability previously unknown to the Bureau (perhaps tapping into a
yet undiscovered Object of Power?). How does this invisibility
work? Does the Distorted become resonance temporarily? Does
it use Hiss resonance to refract light?
\par The physical deformation of this particular Hiss entity is
noteworthy in its thoroughness. Clearly the human host would
have died from such extreme alteration, which prompts the
question: Are the corrupted simply animated corpses?
