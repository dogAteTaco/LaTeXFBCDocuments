\subsection*{ANALYSIS OF HISS THREAT: PART II\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Researchers were sent to transcribe the recursive chant repeated
by the Hiss entities. In the interest of safety, this was done with
the non-aggressive floating Hiss entities, however no distinction
between this repeating phrase and the one repeated by the more
violent Hiss entities has been observed. What is the purpose of
this repeating string of words? Is this how the Hiss corrupts
individuals? Does the chant produce a physical effect? Is it a
message? An incantation?
\par We were able to record a firsthand recitation of the chanting. See
the corresponding audio record.
