\subsection*{ANALYSIS OF HISS THREAT: PART I\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Initial encounters with the entity known as the Hiss have revealed
various behavioral facts. Most notably, the Hiss is able to invade or
corrupt Control Points, Altered Items, and even humans, radically
changing their behavior. Curiously, any person wearing one of the
wearable HRA devices that Dr. Darling has been distributing over
the past weeks was not affected by this corruption.
\par The only known exception to this fact is the new Director, Jesse
Faden, who possesses an inherent immunity to the Hiss. This
could indicate that she has already been corrupted, but her
behavior is so in contrast to that of the other Hiss that I have
dismissed the theory.
\par My final observation comes from Ms. Faden herself. She is able to
"cleanse" material and organisms of the Hiss corruption. We
tested this ability on a Hiss corrupted entity, but unfortunately the
process seems to kill the host. Perhaps the host's physiology
becomes reliant on the Hiss? More work to be done.
