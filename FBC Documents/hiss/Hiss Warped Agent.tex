\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:
	HISS WARPED AGENT
	â€”CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par The Hiss Warped wield only paranatural
abilities, similar to Drifters. They are able
to telekinetically shield themselves with
nearby material and launch objects at
their target. These entities are
particularly destructive and difficult to kill,
possibly indicating a greater internal reinforcement of Hiss
resonance.
\par Why do certain Hiss display paranatural abilities while others rely
on Bureau firearms? Do certain corrupted entities have less
potential than the hosts that become Hiss Warped? Or is this
perhaps an indication of evolution or maturation of the Hiss
corruption? Are there other stages of evolution yet to be found?
What if the Hiss inhabits a host for a month? A year? Do hosts
expire after a certain amount of time? Does the corruption
become too strong for an organic body to endure? Only time (and
well-documented observation) will tell.
