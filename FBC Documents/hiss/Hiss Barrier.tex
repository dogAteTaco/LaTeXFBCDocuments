\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\ HISS BARRIER\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par The Hiss resonance field is a physical impediment that is difficult
to define.
\par Hiss Barriers appear as ways to impede escape or access by
Bureau personnel. Two methods have been discovered for
lowering them. 1) Destroy the multiple concentrated resonance
sources found in the vicinity. 2) Destroy the Hiss entities in the
area.
\par The resonance fields seem to require support for their size and
density from other, non-connected sources of Hiss resonance.
Without the ability to draw from these sources, the Barrier will fall.
\par Does an inactive structure made of Hiss resonance qualify as a
conscious being? Does the distinction make any difference when
considering the Hiss? What does the very act of building walls to
prevent our movement tell us about the Hiss? To what degree is it
watching and planning?
