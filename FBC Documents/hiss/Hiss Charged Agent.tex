\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\HISS CHARGED AGENT\\--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par The Hiss Charged Agents are examples
of extreme physical deformation resulting
from Hiss corruption.
\par Hiss Charged display an unthinking
fixation on any non-corrupted individuals
in the area. Once within a specific proximity, they erupt into a
burst of focused Hiss resonance, so dense that it acts as a
physical force. The Hiss Charged is depleted of the Hiss
corruption after this eruption. The host is left lifeless.
\par This behavior may be an adaptive response to the HRAs. The Hiss
Charged are designed to blow the devices off potential hosts,
exposing them to the resonance. Is the Hiss capable of
customizing a corrupted host's altered ability to this degree? Why
is the physiology of the Hiss Charged so dramatically different
from the host's original form? Lots of questions, no answers.
