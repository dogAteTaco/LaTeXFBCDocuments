\subsection*{ANALYSIS OF HISS THREAT: PART IV \\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par To examine the invasion's timeline of events for possible patterns
in Hiss behavior.
\par Establishing a timeline is difficult at present because of lack of
reliable communications between Bureau sectors and staff.
Preliminary models indicate ground zero of the invasion is located
within the Executive Sector. Once it becomes possible to
interview surviving personnel, pinpointing the exact location
should be feasible.
\par Other outstanding questions that a timeline may help answer:
\par How did the Hiss get past the internal lockdown?
\par How does Hiss resonance advance through space? Deliberately
or uniformly?
\par What is their ultimate goal? The outside world? A cross-
dimensional destination?
