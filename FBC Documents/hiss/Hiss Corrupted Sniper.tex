\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS CORRUPTED SNIPER\\
	-CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Bureau snipers specialize in eliminating
threats from a distance, using the telltale
searchlights affixed to their rifles to
search for targets.
\par Hiss Snipers are no less lethal. The
corruption has not changed their tactics. They clearly prefer to
maintain a good distance from their target, waiting in elevated
positions for a clear shot. Care should be taken in open spaces.
Check the balconies. I should note that their rifles are equipped
with a bayonet for close-quarters combat and the Hiss Snipers
are well aware of how to use it.
\par Refer to file \censor{long text long} for full report.
