\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS CORRUPTED SECURITY\\
	GUARD\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par The Bureau has many internal security
personnel. The Hiss was quick to take
advantage Of this fact.
\par Hiss Guards use the standard-issue
"bullpup" rifles they carried prior to corruption, while the armored
guards carry pump-action shotguns. They have no observed
paranatural abilities, With the exception that certain Hiss Guards
are protected by a shielding of dense Hiss resonance, capable of
stopping bullets. Is this shielding a result of prolonged Hiss
corruption? Does the Hiss mature in organic hosts over time?
More data is needed.
\par Did the Hiss target individuals with combat training? Does the
Hiss have that level of cognizance? Does it utilize hosts for tasks
they are best suited to? Combat-trained hosts are reserved for
combat? These are all questions for later, though it is obvious that
corrupted individuals retain knowledge on the use of their
weapons.
