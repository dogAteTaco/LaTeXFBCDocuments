\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS ELEVATED AGENT\\
	--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}
\par Hiss Elevated Agents display abilities
similar to telekinetic competencies
observed in Bureau parautilitarians.
Some prefer to charge their targets,
while others launch objects at them.
\par Telekinetic attacks have been ineffective
against the Hiss Elevated, due to their own talent in the area.
They do not use any weaponry except their own paranatural
capabilities. Some Hiss Elevated have been seen levitating while
strapped into chairs. This is likely the result of individuals being
corrupted while undergoing cognitive recording in
Parapsychology.
\par How are they able to use paranatural abilities? It is possible that
these individuals were bound to Objects of Power prior to
corruption. It's also worth considering that the Hiss resonance
can identify and express latent paranatural ability in the individuals
it corrupts.
