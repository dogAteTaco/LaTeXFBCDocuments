\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\ HISS CORRUPTED AGENT\\--CONFIDENTIAL--}
\par The Hiss manifest in human hosts in numerous ways. The most common and least intense form is seen in the many corrupted agents floating throughout the Bureau.
\par The Hiss Agents have maintained their human apperance, undergoing no obvious physical transformation. The most notable distinction from an unaffected human is the fact that they levitate.
\par These Hiss have displayed no aggressive behaviour. They only seem interested in vocalizing the strange incantation ad infinitum. Perhaps these vessels are only meant to propagate the Hiss corruption, like spores or wi-fi boosters. Or are they cocoons, preparing to enter their next stage of evolution? When attacked, Hiss Agents disappear, perhaps entering a state of invisibility or undergoing a transformation into purely resonant form?
\par research is ongoing.
