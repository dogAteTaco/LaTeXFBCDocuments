\subsection*{FIELD RESEARCH ON HISS ENTITY:\\
	HISS CORRUPTED TROOPER\\
	â€”CONFIDENTIAL--}
\subsubsection*{SUMMARY:}

\par Troopers are meant to be the first agents
to enter unknown AVVEs, Thresholds, or
any other paranaturally hazardous
situation. They are heavily armored and
heavily armed in preparation for the
worst.
\par As a result of their role, Hiss Troopers have access to the
heaviest armor and weaponry from the Bureau's armory, including
military grade chain guns and grenade launchers. In addition to
their already formidable FBC-issued armor, the Hiss resonance
surrounding these entities is dense enough to stop bullets. If
forced to engage one of these, be sure to make use of any
available cover. Also note that, to the telekinetically-talented,
enemy grenades can be a welcome source of ammunition.
